# CortexFlow

An integrated cognitive agent system combining hierarchical management, memory systems, and cognitive processing.

## Overview

CortexFlow merges multiple AI agent technologies into a unified framework for building, deploying, and managing intelligent agent systems. It integrates:

- **Agent hierarchies** - Structured coordination of multiple specialized agents
- **Memory management** - Persistent and contextual memory systems for agents  
- **Cognitive processing** - Advanced reasoning and knowledge transformation
- **Interactive shell** - Command-line interface for direct agent interaction

## Integration Plan

This repository consolidates functionality from several previously independent projects:

1. **agent-towers** - Hierarchical agent management and coordination
2. **remembrance-agent** - Persistent memory and knowledge retrieval system
3. **CortexIntelligence** - Core intelligence and reasoning capabilities
4. **mindflow** (multiple implementations) - Cognitive workflow processing
5. **mindflow-shell** - Interactive command-line interface

These components are currently included as git submodules in the `.duplicate` directory for reference during integration.

## Development Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Core architecture and API definition
- **Phase 2**: Memory system integration and persistence layer
- **Phase 3**: Cognitive processing pipeline implementation
- **Phase 4**: Interactive shell and user interface development
- **Phase 5**: Comprehensive testing and documentation
